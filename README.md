# Twab

This is a prototype for a minimalist microblogging engine based on browser tabs.  
Don’t forget to check [why this is cool](http://lab.raphaelbastide.com/twab/info.html)!

## Install

It is written with a couple of lines of PHP, just drop it on your server and edit config-example.php. Once you have changed the `userName`, `userpass` and `userurl`, rename config-example.php to config.php.

To write a new message, open `/new.php` in a browser.
