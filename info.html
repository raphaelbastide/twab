  <h1>Why this is is cool?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Light</li>
    <li>Self-hosted</li>
    <li>Radically raw</li>
    <li>Browser-based</li>
    <li>This is universal</li>
    <li>Highly customisable</li>
    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_protocol">Finger protocol</a> compatible</li>
    <li>The HTML page’s content can be anything</li>
    <li>The tab’s favicon can be used as personal picture…</li>
    <p>This demo is an experiment. It will certainly not replace your twitter activity but it may enlarge the definition of microblogging. Twab can be improved for sure while remaining radically simple. If you want to to try it yourself, i’ll be happy to “subscribe” to your tabs!</p>
    <p>The code of this project has been written in 20 minutes, forgive me if it is far from perfect, but it is still <a href="https://github.com/raphaelbastide/twab">open source</a>. And of course, do whatever you want with the idea itself and <a href="mailto:bonjour@raphaelbastide.com">let me know if inspires you</a>!</p>
